<h4>Philosophy</h4>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Commander is designed to promote social games of magic. It is played in a variety of ways, depending on player preference, but a common vision ties together the global community to help them enjoy a different kind of magic. That vision is predicated on a social contract: an agreement which goes beyond these rules to includes a degree of interactivity between players. Players should aim to interact both during the game and before it begins, discussing with other players what they expect/want from the game. House rules or “fair play” exceptions are always encouraged if they result in more fun for the local community.</p>

<h4>Deck Construction Rules</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Players choose a legendary creature as the “Commander” for their deck.&nbsp;</li><li>A card’s&nbsp;<em>color identity</em>&nbsp;is its color plus the color of any mana symbols in the card’s rules text. A card’s color identity is established before the game begins, and cannot be changed by game effects.&nbsp;</li><li>A Commander deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including the Commander.</li><li>With the exception of basic lands, no two cards in the deck may have the same English name. Some cards (e.g.&nbsp;[c]Relentless Rats[/c]) may have rules text that overrides this restriction.</li></ol>

<h4>Play Rules</h4>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:html -->
<ol start="5"><li>Players begin the game with 40 life.</li><li>Commanders begin the game in the Command Zone. While a Commander is in the command zone, it may be cast, subject to the normal timing restrictions for casting creatures. Its owner must pay [mana]2[/mana] for each time it was previously cast from the command zone; this is an additional cost.</li><li>If a Commander would be put into a library, hand, graveyard or exile from anywhere, its owner may choose to move it to the command zone instead.</li><li>Being a Commander is not a characteristic [MTG CR109.3], it is a property of the card and tied directly to the physical card. As such, “Commander-ness” cannot be copied or overwritten by continuous effects. The card retains it’s commander-ness through any status changes, and is still a commander even when controlled by another player.</li><li>If a player has been dealt 21 points of&nbsp;<strong>combat damage</strong>&nbsp;by a particular Commander during the game, that player loses a game.&nbsp;</li><li>Commanders&nbsp;<strong>are</strong>&nbsp;subject to the Legend rule; a player cannot control more than one legend with the same name.</li><li>Abilities which bring card(s) you own from outside the game into the game (such as [c]Living Wish[/c]; [c]Spawnsire of Ulamog[/c]; [c]Karn, the Great Creator[/c]) do not function in Commander.</li></ol>
