<h4>Deck Construction Rules</h4>

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} -->
<ol><li>Players choose a legendary creature as the <strong><em>commander </em></strong>for their deck.Â </li><li>A card's <em>colour identity</em> is its color plus the colour of any mana symbols in the card's rules text. A card's color identity is established before the game begins, and cannot be changed by game effects.   The cards in a deck may not have any colours in their color identity which are not in the colour identity of the deck's commander.</li><li>A Commander deck must contain exactly 100 cards, including the commander.  If you're playing a companion, it must adhere to color identity and singleton rules.  While it is not part of the deck, it is effectively a 101st card. </li><li>With the exception of basic lands, no two cards in the deck may have the same English name. Some cards (e.g. [c]Relentless Rats[/c]) may have rules text that overrides this restriction.</li></ol>

<h4>Play Rules</h4>

<!-- wp:html -->
<ol start="5"><li>Players begin the game with 40 life.</li><li>Commanders begin the game in the Command Zone. While a commander is in the command zone, it may be cast, subject to the normal timing restrictions for casting creatures. Its owner must pay [mana]2[/mana] for each time it was previously cast from the command zone; this is an additional cost.</li><li>If a commander would be put into a library, hand, graveyard or exile from anywhere, its owner may choose to move it to the command zone instead.</li><li>Being a commander is not a characteristic [MTG CR109.3], it is a property of the card and tied directly to the physical card. As such, "commander-ness" cannot be copied or overwritten by continuous effects. The card retains it's commander-ness through any status changes, and is still a commander even when controlled by another player.</li><li>If a player has been dealt 21 points of <strong>combat damage</strong> by a particular Commander during the game, that player loses a game. </li><li>Commanders <strong>are</strong> subject to the Legend rule; a player cannot control more than one legend with the same name.</li><li>Abilities which bring other card(s) you own from outside the game into the game (such as [c]Living Wish[/c]; [c]Spawnsire of Ulamog[/c]; [c]Karn, the Great Creator[/c]) do not function in Commander.</li></ol>
